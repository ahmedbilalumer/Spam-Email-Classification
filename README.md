# Email Classification Project

# Overview
This project focuses on building and evaluating classification models to predict email categories using a dataset of email content. The primary goal is to preprocess the data, select suitable models, train and evaluate them, and optimize performance.

# Dataset
The dataset contains email content with various word frequencies and a "Prediction" column indicating the target variable for classification.

# Steps Involved
1. Data Preparation
Load the Dataset: Read the CSV file containing the email data.
Handle Missing Values: Check and handle any missing values in the dataset.
Encode Categorical Variables: Encode the target variable if necessary.
Scale Numerical Features: Standardize the numerical features for better model performance.
2. Model Selection
Explore Algorithms: Consider Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Choose the Best Algorithm: Based on initial performance metrics.
3. Model Training
Split Dataset: Divide the data into training and testing sets.
Train Models: Train the chosen models using the training data.
4. Model Evaluation
Evaluate Models: Assess models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Cross-Validation: Ensure models generalize well to new data.
5. Optimization (Pro Tips)
Ensemble Methods: Experiment with Random Forests or Gradient Boosting for better performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use grid search or random search for optimal hyperparameters.

# Results
The performance of each model is evaluated using the following metrics:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score

# Conclusion
This project showcases the process of building, training, and evaluating classification models. Experimentation with different algorithms and hyperparameter tuning can significantly enhance model performance.
